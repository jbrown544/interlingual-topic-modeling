#### Unsupervised Thematic Discovery in Non-English Natural Language Corpora

**Project:**
---
In this exploration, the primary goal is to discover methods for applying modern NLP thematic modeling to generate intuition over non-English language corpora without requiring source document translation. Secondary goals are to discover techniques for hyperparameter optimization and to develop reusable interlingual tools portable across text sources.  Inputs into the proposed processes will be unstructured therefore the design will make few assumptions about data structure allowing for flexibility with varied sources and languages.
